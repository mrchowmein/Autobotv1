# Autobotv1
Autobot is an autonomous robot program that allows your Lego EV3 tank to navigate on its own.  It uses an infrared sensor to determine changes in the light levels as the robot approaches a wall or an obstacle. Once an obstacle has been detected, the tank was stop and turn to avoid the wall or object and continuing moving.
